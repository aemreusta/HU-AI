# Sorting and Searching Algorithms Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves the implementation and analysis of various sorting and searching algorithms in Java. The goal is to empirically validate the theoretical time complexities of these algorithms through practical execution and measurement across different input sizes and conditions (random, sorted, and reverse sorted datasets).

## Algorithms Implemented

### Sorting Algorithms
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Counting Sort

### Searching Algorithms
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

## Performance Evaluation

The performance of each algorithm has been evaluated and compared in terms of execution time across varying input sizes. The analysis includes:
- Sorting performance on random, sorted, and reversely sorted data.
- Searching performance on random and sorted data.

## Graphs and Analysis

Performance graphs are included in the report, providing a visual representation of each algorithm's efficiency under different conditions.

## Getting Started

To run the sorting and searching algorithms:
1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the source code directory.
4. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
5. Run the main class: `java Main`

## Project Structure

- `/src`: Contains the Java source files for each algorithm.
- `/graphs`: Contains the performance graphs generated from the analysis.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report of the project, including problem definition, solution implementation, results, analysis, and conclusions.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and issue a pull request with your enhancements or fixes.
