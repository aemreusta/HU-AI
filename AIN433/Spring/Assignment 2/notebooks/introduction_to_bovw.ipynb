    "\n",
    "This notebook addresses the task of image classification using the Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) model, leveraging keypoint description methods such as SIFT/SURF and ORB, combined with KMeans clustering. The BOVW model represents images as a collection of distinct features - keypoints and descriptors, facilitating image classification and similarity identification. The assignment explores the process of extracting these features, matching them across images, and classifying the images based on the generated features. This approach is central to many computer vision tasks and is foundational for understanding more complex models."

    "## Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bag of Visual Words model is an approach used in computer vision for image classification and retrieval. It involves representing images through the aggregation of local features. Key points of an image are identified, descriptors for these keypoints are generated, and a visual dictionary (or vocabulary) is created by clustering these descriptors. Each image is then represented as a frequency histogram of these features, allowing for efficient comparison and classification."

    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this assignment is to implement the BOVW framework from scratch, focusing on the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keypoint Detection:** Using SIFT or Harris-Laplacian for identifying distinct points in an image.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting keypoints using methods like SIFT/SURF and ORB.\n",
    "- **Feature Matching:** Matching features across images based on Euclidean distance.\n",
    "- **BoW Formation:** Clustering features to form a visual dictionary and quantizing images to histograms.\n",
    "- **Classification:** Employing the k-NN approach to classify images and evaluating the performance of different visual vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through these steps, we aim to explore the effectiveness of different keypoint description methods and clustering approaches in classifying images and understanding the impact of various factors on the accuracy and runtime of the classification."

    "## Importance of SIFT/SURF, ORB, and KMeans Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SIFT/SURF:** These are feature detection algorithms that identify and describe local features in images. They are robust to changes in scale, rotation, and illumination. SIFT and SURF differ in their complexity and speed, providing a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n",
    "- **ORB:** A fast feature detector and descriptor, ORB is designed to achieve similar performance to SIFT but at a lower computational cost. It is particularly useful for real-time applications.\n",
    "- **KMeans Clustering:** This clustering method is used to group the extracted features into a set number of clusters, forming the visual vocabulary. KMeans is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in creating a compact visual dictionary that can represent a wide range of images."
